Feature: Map out users on Network
  As an IT administrator
  So I can assess the current users security risks??
  View the people currently using the network (Wireless and wired)

Scenario: Seeing non compliant users
  When I go to the home page
  And I click on "See users"
  Then I should see All Ip addresses using the network
